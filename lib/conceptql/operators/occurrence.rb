  module Operators
    # Represents a operator that will grab the Nth occurrence of something
    #
    # Specify occurrences as integers, excluding O
    # 1 => first
    # 2 => second
    # ...
    # -1 => last
    # -2 => second-to-last
    #
    # The operator treats all streams as a single, large stream.  It partitions
    # that larget stream by person_id, then sorts within those groupings
    # by start_date and then select at most one row per person, regardless
    # of how many different types of streams enter the operator
    #
    # If two rows have the same start_date, the order of their ranking
    # is arbitrary
    #
    # If we ask for the second occurrence of something and a person has only one
    # occurrence, this operator returns nothing for that person

      desc <<-EOF
Groups all results by person, then orders by start_date and finds the nth occurrence (can be positive or negative).
1 => first
2 => second

If two results have the same start_date, their relative order
is arbitrary.

If we ask for the second occurrence of something and a person has only one
occurrence, this operator returns nothing for that person.
