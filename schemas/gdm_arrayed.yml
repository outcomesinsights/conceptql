      cost and the dispensing fee. If the paid_ingredient_cost or paid_dispensing_fee

      using the following formula: paid_ingredient_cost + paid_dispensing_fee. If

      reported on the secondary payer insurance claim. If the source data has actual
      primary insurance payments (e.g. the primary insurance payment is not a derivative
      of the payer claim and there is verification another insurance company paid
      an amount to the provider), then the primary insurance payment should have it's

      is not a calculated field, but a field available directly in claims data. Use
      case: This will capture non-covered services. Non-covered services are indicated
      by an amount allowed and patient responsibility variables (copay, coinsurance,
      deductible) will be equal $0 in the source data. This means the patient is responsible
      for the total_charged value. The amount_allowed field is payer specific and
