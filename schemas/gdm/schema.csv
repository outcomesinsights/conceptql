In claims data, generally there is one field representing the total payment from the payer for the service/device/drug. However, this field could be a calculated field if the source data provides separate payment information for the ingredient cost and the dispensing fee. If the paid_ingredient_cost or paid_dispensing_fee fields are populated with nonzero values, the paid_by_payer field is calculated using the following formula: paid_ingredient_cost + paid_dispensing_fee. If there is more than one Payer in the source data, several cost records indicate that fact. The Payer reporting this reimbursement should be indicated under the payer_plan_id field.",,

If the source data has actual patient payments (e.g. the patient payment is not a derivative of the payer claim and there is verification the patient paid an amount to the provider), then the patient payment should have it's own cost record with a payer_plan_id set to 0 to indicate the payer is actually the patient, and the actual patient payment should be noted under the total_paid field.

Typically, this is a percentage of the expenses defined by the Payer Plan after the patient's deductible is exceeded. paid_patient_coinsurance does contribute to the paid_by_patient variable.

If the source data has actual primary insurance payments (e.g. the primary insurance payment is not a derivative of the payer claim and there is verification another insurance company paid an amount to the provider), then the primary insurance payment should have it's own cost record with a payer_plan_id set to the applicable payer, and the actual primary insurance payment should be noted under the paid_by_payer field.",,

This is similar to the total_paid amount in that it shows what the payer expects the provider to be reimbursed after the payer and patient pay. This differs from the total_paid amount in that it is not a calculated field, but a field available directly in claims data. Use case: This will capture non-covered services. Non-covered services are indicated by an amount allowed and patient responsibility variables (copay, coinsurance, deductible) will be equal $0 in the source data.
